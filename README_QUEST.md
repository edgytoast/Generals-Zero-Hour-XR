# Generals: Zero Hour XR

An unofficial Meta Quest 3 tabletop port of *Command & Conquer: Generals – Zero Hour*. The original game's terrain, units and effects appear as a stereoscopic miniature battlefield, with separate spatial build, command and settings windows. This is a community project, not an Electronic Arts product or endorsement.

> **Apple Vision Pro port (this fork, branch `visionos-port`):** a native visionOS version of the tabletop, with look-and-pinch controls. Early but playable. See **[README_VISIONOS.md](README_VISIONOS.md)** for status, build steps and video.

These are headset captures supplied by the project maintainer. Map, faction, graphics settings and room lighting vary; the images illustrate the tabletop presentation rather than certify a particular APK build.

## What works in the Quest preview

- Native OpenXR stereo tabletop gameplay using the original Zero Hour game world, not replacement models.
- Campaign and offline AI Skirmish in the tabletop presentation; cinematics and full native dialogs appear upright.
- Touch-controller selection, drag-box multi-selection, contextual orders, map pan/rotate/zoom, radar navigation, building rotation, groups and waypoint routes.
- Detached build window, persistent Commands window and a spatial UI panel; move, tilt, scale or recenter the workspace. Optional detected-surface or manual-height placement does not require a room scan.
- Matching UI, Commands and Ground View shortcuts beside the board. During live offline Campaign and Skirmish gameplay, Ground View offers an optional human-scale, passive view of visible terrain; controller walking and turning are experimental, with B/Y returning to the unchanged tabletop. Videos and scripted camera sequences use the regular presentation.
- English and German XR interface/help, left-handed controller mode, hover names and build costs.
- An XR Victory/Defeat/Match over card remains visible across the transition to match statistics.
- Quest 3 defaults: Balanced resolution, Light shadows and Multiview. Higher quality modes, including Ultra+, are optional and may cost performance.

The **supported preview path is offline play**. Human LAN/Internet multiplayer, replay XR, keyboard/mouse input and persistent room anchors are **not release-ready**. Direct Connect can start an experimental LAN match, but Quest–PC games currently fail simulation synchronization. Do not use a LAN diagnostic APK as the public preview. See [multiplayer status](docs/WORKDIR/planning/MULTIPLAYER_STATUS.md).

## Get the current offline APK

Download the release-signed [`Generals-Zero-Hour-XR.apk`](https://github.com/Cesarus85/Generals-Zero-Hour-XR/releases/download/v1.2.28-xr-preview/Generals-Zero-Hour-XR.apk) from the [1.2.28 XR preview release](https://github.com/Cesarus85/Generals-Zero-Hour-XR/releases/tag/v1.2.28-xr-preview). This is the public offline preview build, not an experimental LAN diagnostic APK. Older development releases are retained privately as drafts; use the linked release for new installations.

- APK SHA-256: `fc04349550027cab90964261e6eb221e4f4947c41ec57ff6def03529ca88ca20` (also in the release's `.sha256` asset).
- Android package: `com.generalsx.zerohour.xr` (retained for update compatibility)
- Android versionCode: `10228`; versionName: `1.2.28-xr-preview`.

The 1.2.28 release adds the accepted Android terrain batching from P26-2. On the measured maximum-zoom Campaign scene it reduced frame time from 42.00 to 34.30 ms without lowering terrain detail; results vary by map and battle load. It also includes the post-1.2.25 board-mesh churn reduction. Campaign Ground View transitions and long-session walking, collision and comfort remain incremental validation areas. Use the exact release link above rather than an older APK or a copied APK from the LAN branch. See [release preparation](docs/WORKDIR/audit/RELEASE_PREPARATION_XR.md) for verification and open validation work.

## Install and play

1. Supply your own legally obtained, complete *Generals* **and** *Zero Hour* installation. The APK/repository contains no retail `.big` archives, maps, videos or other game data. See [which files to copy](docs/HOWTO/GETTING_THE_GAME_FILES.md).
2. Enable Quest Developer Mode, connect the headset by USB and accept its debugging prompt. With Android platform-tools installed, run `adb devices`, then `adb -s <quest-serial> install -r Generals-Zero-Hour-XR.apk`. The `-r` update keeps the existing app's settings and selected game folders; uninstalling does not. The maintainer's Quest updated through the release-signed 10223 test build without uninstalling; other prior signing lineages have not been tested. See the [release-preparation audit](docs/WORKDIR/audit/RELEASE_PREPARATION_XR.md).
3. Open **Generals: Zero Hour XR** in the Quest app library. On first run, the English/German data assistant guides you through choosing the Zero Hour folder and, if needed, the separate base Generals folder. It accepts complete Steam installs and installed/extracted CD/ISO layouts, not raw ISO images or Windows installers.
4. Start a campaign or offline Skirmish. The board, build window and Commands window appear in front of you. Use `UI → Set up play space` only if you want to reposition them or choose a detected table/floor.

See the [full Quest installation, placement and controller guide](docs/HOWTO/INSTALLATION_XR.md). If something fails, the Setup app's **View Logs → Share** exports diagnostic logs; please avoid posting private paths or room details publicly.

### Essential controls (right-handed default)

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| Right Trigger | Select or order at the ray target; hold and drag for a selection box |
| Left Grip + selection | Add or remove a unit |
| Left Thumbstick | Pan the map; click to return the map camera to your base |
| Right Thumbstick | Rotate and zoom |
| A | Show/hide Commands |
| B or system menu | Open/close the game menu |
| X | Recenter the board and companion windows in front of you |
| Right Grip | Cancel an armed order or clear selection |

The Commands window also has an in-game help guide. In left-handed mode, the logical hand and A/B/X/Y roles swap. For groups: select units → **Replace group** → number, or select additional units → **New / Extend** → number. For waypoints: select units → **Waypoints** → destinations → **Waypoints** again. See the [complete control reference](docs/HOWTO/INSTALLATION_XR.md#controller-controls) for radar, building rotation and window editing.

## Source, lineage and licensing

This repository contains the Quest-focused extension of the community [GeneralsZH-Android](https://github.com/tarek369/GeneralsZH-Android) work, through the developer's [Android fork](https://github.com/Cesarus85/GeneralsZH-Android), together with the [GeneralsX](https://github.com/fbraz3/GeneralsX), [Fighter19](https://github.com/Fighter19/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour) and [TheSuperHackers](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode) lineage. The Android foundation and XR work are distinct contributions; the original game and assets remain EA's. Engine source is released under GPLv3 with EA's additional terms; see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) and the source history for conditions and attribution. This is an independent community port, not an EA, Westwood Studios or rights-holder product or endorsement. The source license does not grant rights to EA trademarks.

To build from source, initialize submodules and follow the [Android port guide](docs/port/ANDROID_PORT.md). With its SDK/NDK and vcpkg prerequisites installed:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
./scripts/build/android/build-android-zh.sh
GX_FLAVORS=xr ./scripts/build/android/package-android-zh.sh
```

The XR APK is emitted at `build/apk/Generals-Zero-Hour-XR.apk`. Builds do not fetch retail game data. The source tree also retains inherited Android/Apple targets, but their features and release status are not claims about this Quest edition.

The command above builds a **debug** APK. For the publication build, the
maintainer must configure a private signing key outside Git and use
`GX_FLAVORS=xr ./scripts/build/android/package-android-zh.sh --release`.
That path emits `build/apk/Generals-Zero-Hour-XR-release.apk` and fails if
private signing inputs are absent; the exact signing, update-migration and
verification procedure is in the [release-preparation audit](docs/WORKDIR/audit/RELEASE_PREPARATION_XR.md).

The [XR current status](docs/WORKDIR/planning/XR_CURRENT_STATUS.md) tracks acceptance and remaining work. [Release preparation](docs/WORKDIR/audit/RELEASE_PREPARATION_XR.md) records the exact candidate, checks and publication gates.
